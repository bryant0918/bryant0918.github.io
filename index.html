<h1 id="hey-im-bryant">Hey, I’m Bryant</h1>
<p>I am a senior at Brigham Young University studying Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACME) with an emphasis in Linguistics. I have always loved and been skilled at math and in High School I got myself interested in programming. I taught myself the basics of Python and learned to code simple games like Snake. </p>
<p>I served a volunteer mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Poland for 25 months. I learned to read, write and speak Polish. Since returning home to my studies I became more interested in linguistics. I refined my 4 years of high school Spanish, took another Polish class and began learning Russian. I've found the intersection of my interests lies in computational linguistics, specifically NLP and Machine Translation. </p>
<p>I am married to my beautiful wife Taylor and we have a sweet boy named Cohen. Outside of spending time with my family I am still always working on my own projects, some of which I will post here.</p>
<p>I am also involved in a small private consulting gig called Parsha Works. Feel free to contact me or click on the Parsha Works link to the left for any questions, help on projects, or career opportunities.</p>
