<h1 id="hey-im-bryant">Hey, I’m Bryant</h1>
<p>I am a senior at Brigham Young University studying Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACME) with an emphasis in Linguistics. I have always loved and been skilled at math and in High School I got myself interested in programming. I taught myself the basics of Python and learned to code simple games like Snake. </p>
<p>I served a volunteer mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Poland for 25 months. I learned to read, write and speak Polish. Since returning home to my studies I became more interested in linguistics. I refined my 4 years of high school Spanish, took another Polish class and began learning Russian. I've found the intersection of my interests lies in computational linguistics, specifically NLP and Machine Translation. </p>
<p>I am married to my beautiful wife Taylor and we have a sweet boy named Cohen. Outside of spending time with my family I am still always working on my own projects, some of which I will post here, as well as a small private consulting gig with more proprietary data. Feel free to contact me for any questions, help on projects, or career opportunities.</p>
<p>I don’t use social media much these days, but I do have a presence on several platforms:</p>
